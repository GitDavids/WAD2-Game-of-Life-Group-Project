    <p>This app is meant to share interesting sessions on Conwayâ€™s game of life. 
        This is a game played without any active players, the only thing that is required 
        is an initial state of 0s and 1s (or black and white spots on a grid). 
        The state then continuously evolves based on the initial state, sometimes creating 
        unique and mesmerising patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
        This application is to give people who are interested in this game the 
        opportunity to share and see cool design evolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
        To find out more about the game logic, head to the <a id="game_logic" href="{% url 'game_of_life:game_logic' %}">Game Logic</a> page.
